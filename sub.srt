1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,133
T minus 20 seconds.

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,432
Stage two tanks
pressing for flight.

3
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:04,900
Flight computer has
control of the vehicle.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,166
Do we see anything on the
sensors that's a problem?

5
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:08,533
- Anything right now?
- Nothing.

6
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:11,833
Well, I'll say go for launch.

7
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,500
T minus 10.
9.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,432
8.

9
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,366
7.

10
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:16,100
6.

11
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,033
5.

12
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,567
4.

13
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:19,899
3.

14
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,866
2.

15
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,800
1.

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:36,633
[cheering]

17
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,934
It's going, baby.

18
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,833
Come on, baby.

19
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,667
Let's go. [inaudible].

20
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,533
Check it out.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,466
Speed bumped by two kilometers
per second [inaudible]

22
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,033
Shortly after
main engine cutoff,

23
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,632
we're going to
separate the stages

24
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:10,533
and begin the second
stage ignition.

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,266
Come on!

26
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:27,233
[cheering]

27
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:30,633
The first stage
is returning to land

28
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,833
as the second stage
powers the [inaudible]

29
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,633
satellites to low-Earth orbit.

30
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,299
The [inaudible] have
successfully deployed.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,567
The first stage will soon
begin its series of three burns

32
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:52,165
to head back towards
Cape Canaveral.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Where's the-- OK, this is bad.

34
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:18,699
[cheering]

35
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,866
That is that first
stage coming back down.

36
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,766
History in the making, guys.

37
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,834
It's standing up.

38
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:53,500
It sounded like an explosion.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,567
Yeah, man!

40
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,533
Oh my god.

41
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:58,466
Look at this.

42
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,767
Look it, it's just
sitting there.

43
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,400
Look at that!

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,933
What!

45
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,599
Holy smokes, man!

46
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:13,933
It's kind of amazing that
this window of opportunity

47
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:17,265
is open for life
to go beyond Earth.

48
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,834
And we just don't know
how long that window

49
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:21,567
is going to be open.

50
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,599
But the thing that
gets me most fired up

51
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,366
is that creating a
self-sustaining civilization

52
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:30,066
on Mars, it would be the
greatest adventure ever,

53
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,766
ever in human history.

54
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,066
It would be so exciting
to wake up in the morning

55
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,432
and think that that's
what's happening.
